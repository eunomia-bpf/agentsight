# AgentProf Evaluation Frontier

## Purpose

This file records the current experiment frontier: paper-level RQs, admitted
results, raw artifact locations, and the next empirical decision. It is not a
gate registry, claim ledger, checker transcript, freeze protocol, or complete
history. The 360 KB pre-recovery version is preserved at
`docs/tmp/cycle-0001-20260711T164850-0700/03-review-gate/idea-regression-recovery-20260712T021723-0700/archive-pre-recovery/evaluation.md`.

The current RQs were restored after the three-round user-directed review. An
experiment receives one RQ verbatim and tests one hypothesis within it. A
failed mechanism may change the next mechanism, signal, workload, or protocol,
but it does not change the RQ or weaken the fixed positive hypothesis. Only a
later explicit user instruction may change the four author-fixed RQs.

## RQ Frontier

| RQ | Fixed question | Positive hypothesis | Next evidence need |
|---|---|---|---|
| RQ1 | Does Semantic Profiling Improve Resource Attribution? | Semantic operation stacks reunite recurring responsibility fragmented across executions and improve attribution of independently recorded additive resources while preserving source lineage and mass. | Compare flat, source-native, and one fixed semantic profile against independent tool/span/process resource identities on real traces. |
| RQ2 | Does Profiler Output Correspond to Real Problems? | A target-blind semantic profile concentrates independently annotated failures, unsafe effects, redundant work, or task boundaries and reduces analyst inspection without using target labels. | Preserve the complete positive AgentProcessBench AP result and run a second independently planned construction that turns semantic concentration into a stable work-to-50 reduction without target-label tuning. |
| RQ3 | How Accurate Are the Tags? | A target-blind fixed tagger or mapping assigns accurate and stable task, phase, action, and boundary identities on unseen agents and task families without materially corrupting attribution. | Evaluate one frozen tagger or mapping on held-out real families with independent labels and downstream attribution sensitivity. |
| RQ4 | What Is the Profiling Cost? | Complete profile construction has practical predictable scaling, and cached field derivation makes repeated profile queries substantially cheaper than initial construction and repeated raw-trace review. | Measure end-to-end construction, memory, output size, and repeated-query cost across complete real workloads and scaling points. |

## Admitted RQ1 Mechanism Evidence

The retained RQ1 numbers come from the R170 local full-history corpus and two
deterministic analyses over that generated evidence:

- **Input and collection.** R170 scanned all discovered readable Codex/Claude
  histories under the configured 10,000-session/file caps, used a local
  llama.cpp-compatible Qwen2.5-3B tagger with a seeded cache, and produced 325
  sessions and 183,714 system-effect observations. The exact collection command
  and environment are recorded in `docs/visexp/EXPERIMENT_TRACKER.md` under
  R170; the committed summary is
  `docs/visexp/out/full-history-r170.json`.
- **Grouping ablation.** R224 ran
  `python3 docs/visexp/r131_semantic_ablation.py --input
  .agentsight/agentflame/r170-full-current --local-out
  .agentsight/agentflame/ablations-r224-r170/summary.json --out-dir
  docs/visexp/out/semantic-ablation-r224-r170`. Raw committed results are
  `docs/visexp/out/semantic-ablation-r224-r170/semantic-ablation-r131.json`
  with provenance in `r224-rerun-metadata.json`. It compares no-semantic,
  session-only, prompt-only, and session-plus-prompt projections over identical
  R170 observations. Every projection conserves 183,714 units; mixed-bucket
  weight is 90.402%, 84.407%, 36.722%, and 0% respectively, with the final row a
  construction check rather than independent semantic evidence. Stack counts
  are 11,967, 15,027, 24,703, and 26,829.
- **Association beyond session.** R251 ran
  `python3 docs/visexp/r251_behavior_tag_alignment.py` over the R170 folded
  stacks and 1,000 session-preserving prompt-tag permutations. Raw results are
  `docs/visexp/out/behavior-tag-alignment-r251/behavior-tag-alignment-r251.json`
  and `session-shuffle-null-r251.csv`. Prompt tags retain 8.419% weighted
  behavior information beyond session versus a 1.903% null p95
  (`p=0.0010`, permutation resolution 1/1001).
- **Measure sensitivity.** R225 reports the duration-versus-effect ranking
  comparison used in the paper at
  `docs/visexp/out/prompt-span-duration-r225/prompt-span-duration-r225.json`:
  top-10 overlap 7/10 and Spearman 0.623. Prompt spans may contain idle/user
  wait time and are not true active-runtime measurements.

These are admitted mechanism/accounting results only. R170 records a dirty
working-tree provenance boundary; prompt tags define the declared grouping
reference; R251 has no human adequacy labels. The evidence supports mass
conservation, declared-category separation, and weighted association beyond
session membership. It does not establish correct semantic intent, causal
lineage, developer utility, or the final RQ1 answer.

## Admitted RQ2 Evidence And Boundaries

The complete AgentProcessBench experiment provides current supporting RQ2
evidence without yet authorizing a paper result. On all 1,000 official
trajectories and 8,509 human-labeled assistant steps, the target-preserving
semantic profile improves equal-family macro AP over raw action by 0.031522
with a paired 95% interval of [0.015138, 0.053514]. The matched within-raw-leaf
shuffle control gives `p=0.009950`, so the AP gain exceeds pure refinement
granularity. The raw-minus-semantic work-to-50 point estimate is favorable at
0.016320, but its interval [-0.022550, 0.074214] crosses zero. The valid tested
construction is therefore `INCONCLUSIVE`, with positive AP specificity and an
unresolved inspection-work condition. Complete plan, implementation reviews,
preflight, full execution, and independent recalculation are under
`docs/tmp/cycle-0002-20260712T201943-0700/01-experiment-gate/loop-rq2-agentprocessbench/`.

Three other current-cycle constructions remain internal boundaries. The
CodeTraceBench comparison was valid but mixed, ToolSafe was valid but
contradicted for its tested cross-family construction, and the full AgentNet
comparison showed that dropping `target` from the semantic key invalidates the
intended comparison. Their reports remain under the corresponding
`loop-rq2-codetracebench/`, `loop-rq2-toolsafe/`, and `loop-rq2-agentnet/`
directories. None changes RQ2 or the positive hypothesis.

Two complete negative conditions remain auditable and constrain mechanism
reuse; neither changes RQ2 or belongs in the final paper's positive result
story.

- **Revision 0 — flattened induced leaves.** AgentRx AP was 0.02584 at 0.02236
  prevalence, and TELBench AP was 0.21487 at 0.21384 prevalence. The unchanged
  leaf inducer therefore supplies no positive RQ2 evidence. Full plan,
  execution, raw artifacts, and independent review are under
  `docs/tmp/cycle-0001-20260711T164850-0700/01-experiment-gate/loop-rq2-00/`.
- **Revision 2 — Hodoscope comparison.** The official density-gap/FPS bundle
  reached the published iQuest behavior at first-hit rank 2.9 +/- 0.3, while
  the tested 8/32/128 recursive stack reached 24.9 +/- 15.8. The tested
  recursive hierarchy had no stable advantage over its matched flat terminal
  partition or released turn-position grouping. This is a valid boundary for
  that sparse action-level signal, not evidence that flatness caused the gap or
  that RQ2 should shrink. Full artifacts and review are under
  `docs/tmp/cycle-0001-20260711T164850-0700/01-experiment-gate/loop-rq2-02/`.

The unexecuted revision-1 plan is superseded because it bundled roughly eleven
comparator types and several independent research programs. Its history remains
under
`docs/tmp/cycle-0001-20260711T164850-0700/01-experiment-gate/loop-rq2-01/`.

Older experiments remain under `docs/visexp/out/` with source scripts under
`docs/visexp/` and `script/`. A number returns to the paper only after its exact
input, oracle separation, baseline information, metric, and raw path are
rechecked; old readiness booleans are not evidence.

## Requirements For The Next Experiment

The next experiment follows one bounded literature/source screen and must
satisfy these project-local controls:

1. answer one paper-level RQ and one decisive uncertainty;
2. state one primary outcome and the strongest competing explanation;
3. reuse a published protocol, official benchmark, real agent system, or public
   trace source whenever possible;
4. compare the method with the smallest set of strongest fair baselines;
5. match visible information, tuning opportunity, and evaluation budget;
6. run a real end-to-end preflight, then every planned cell and repetition to
   terminal status;
7. retain negative, invalid, and inconclusive rows;
8. separate run validity from the scientific answer;
9. keep the assigned RQ and positive hypothesis fixed; improve the mechanism,
   signal, workload, or protocol when a tested construction fails;
10. reject optional reviewer robustness that would turn the experiment into a
    second research program.

## Next Evidence Selection

The current RQ2 frontier is no longer source discovery. AgentProcessBench is a
complete official four-family benchmark with independent human step labels and
released blind judge outputs, and the first target-preserving construction has
already established semantic-specific AP concentration beyond a matched
granularity control. The remaining uncertainty is whether a principled
semantic profile can convert that concentration into a stable reduction in the
operations required to recover half of the harmful steps.

The next experiment must retain the exact RQ2 and positive hypothesis. It may
change the profiling/ranking construction, visible signal, or workload
protocol, but it may not weaken the claim, remove work-to-50, choose fields or
thresholds from the now-observed human labels, or rewrite the completed result.
Before proposing Revision 2, perform a bounded external search for published
group-ranking, risk-coverage, or diagnostic-inspection protocols and choose the
simplest construction that directly targets early inspection concentration.
Prefer an independently published mechanism and, when available, a fresh real
public validation source over target-label retuning on AgentProcessBench.

The new plan must state one construction and one hypothesis, preserve
`target` and the raw local leaf, use real complete data, and pass at least three
serial independent plan reviews before REAL PREFLIGHT. The existing
AgentProcessBench result remains the fixed prior observation; it cannot be
recomputed into a different verdict.

## Experiment History Policy

Detailed plans, reviews, commands, results, and failures live in timestamped
cycle reports. This file keeps only the current RQ table, admitted results, and
next decision. Superseded plans stay linkable but never regain authority merely
because a resumed agent finds them first.
